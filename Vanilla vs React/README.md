# Vanilla vs React :baby:
A small project to highlight the differences between Vanilla JS using modules and basic React.

## Objectives
- Highlight differences
- Have 2 different components
- Introduce the concept of `Props` (_Properties_) required & optional
- Reuse of a component

> In order to use modules in Vanilla JS, a server is required. [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) is one of the options.
