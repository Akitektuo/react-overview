# Tic Tac Toe - Styling :barber:
Added small changes to the existing Tic Tac Toe project to highlight SCSS, modules, and better management of multiple class names.

## Objectives
- Make the UI more pleasing
- Change all CSS files to SCSS
- Have example of at least one SCSS global file
- Make use of SCSS modules in order to encapsulate styles
- Showcase the `classNames` library by using conditional class names in React and more classes defined on the same element in SCSS
