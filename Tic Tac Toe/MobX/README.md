Replace `useState` with MobX. Highlight the removal of the complexity and focus on the business logic.

## Objectives
- Get rid of `useState`
- Showcase the basics of MobX and the difference in complexity
- Extract business logic to the store
- Leave the _TicTacToeGame.tsx_ to do the rendering, not the logic
