# Tic Tac Toe - Vanilla vs React :x::o:
A small project to highlight a more complex scenario using state management and components with React compared to Vanilla JS.

## Objectives
- Highlight state differences, the complexity of using Vanilla JS optimally
- Have multiple components, use of `map()`
- Introduce the concept of **Controlled** components
- Have a principal state, controlling all components
- Have a working Tic Tac Toe game

> In order to use modules in Vanilla JS, a server is required. [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) is one of the options.
